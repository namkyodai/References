	inability of existing bridge management systems to determine optimal
	management strategies when multiple bridges may be adversely affected
	simultaneously. The supply and demand system approach alleviates
	this limitation because the optimization problem is formulated to
	minimize overall costs on the transportation network. The optimization
	problem is formulated focusing on the ability of the transportation
	network as a whole ~system! to provide an adequate level of service,
	taking into consideration the role and performance of the bridges
	in the network ~supply! and the consequences if an adequate level
	of service is not provided ~demand!. The supply and demand system
	approach is illustrated by determining the optimal management strategies
	for five bridges in a real transportation network subjected to two
	hazard scenarios: overloading due to traffic and scouring due to
	flooding. The main conclusion is that the supply and demand system
	approach is a rational approach to the development of optimal management
	strategies when bridges are adversely affected and may become nonoperational

  abstract  = {Before an optimal bridge management strategy can be determined in
	existing bridge management systems, there must first be a determination
	of the type and schedule of interventions to be performed on each
	element of the bridge to achieve a minimal-cost long-term steady
	state. Once these element-level strategies are known, they are grouped
	together, or bundled, to develop a management strategy for the bridge.
	This is currently done with a set of agency rules without regard
	to whether the bundle of interventions is optimal. Interventions
	are bundled because it is not desirable to perform interventions
	on the same bridge in successive years, principally because of user
	costs. The work discussed here uses inventory theory to bundle interventions
	on bridges optimally with multiple elements. Two examples are presented.
	Example 1 shows how a basic joint replenishment model can be used
	on a multielement bridge to determine optimal management strategies
	when interventions are bundled and a single-stage policy is used.
	Example 2 shows how a joint replenishment model with quantity discounts
	can be used to alleviate some of the problems with a basic joint
	replenishment model. The optimal management strategy determined in
	Example 2 is compared with the optimal management strategy determined
	when interventions are not bundled. Direction for future work is
	given.},

	discussed in the literature: time-based maintenance (TBM) and condition-based
	maintenance (CBM). The paper discusses how the \{TBM\} and \{CBM\}
	techniques work toward maintenance decision making. Recent research
	articles covering the application of each technique are reviewed.
	The paper then compares the challenges of implementing each technique
	from a practical point of view, focusing on the issues of required
	data determination and collection, data analysis/modelling, and decision
	making. The paper concludes with significant considerations for future
	research. Each of the techniques was found to have unique concepts/principles,
	procedures, and challenges for real industrial practise. It can be
	concluded that the application of the \{CBM\} technique is more realistic,
	and thus more worthwhile to apply, than the \{TBM\} one. However,
	further research on \{CBM\} must be carried out in order to make
	it more realistic for making maintenance decisions. The paper provides
	useful information regarding the application of the \{TBM\} and \{CBM\}
	techniques in maintenance decision making and explores the challenges

  abstract  = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior
	(Ajzen, 1985, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed.
	In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical
	evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can
	be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior,
	subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions,
	together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable
	variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived
	behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of
	salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior,
	but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value
	formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with
	these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures
	is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally,
	inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to
	provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue
	that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning
	this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite
	well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.

  abstract            = {Considerable benefits have been gained from using Markov decision
	processes to select condition-based maintenance policies for the
	asset management of infrastructure systems. A key part of the method
	is using a Markov process to model the deterioration of condition.
	However, the Markov model assumes constant transition probabilities
	irrespective of how long an item has been in a state. The semi-Markov
	model relaxes this assumption. This paper describes how to fit a
	semi-Markov model to observed condition data and the results achieved
	on two data sets. Good results were obtained even where there was
	only 1 year of observation data.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We present a statistical process control framework to support
	structural health monitoring of transportation infrastructure. We
	contribute an integrated, generally-applicable (to various types
	of structural response data) statistical approach that links the
	literatures on statistical performance modeling and on structural
	health monitoring. The framework consists of two parts: The first,
	estimation of statistical models to explain, predict, and control
	for common-cause variation in the data, i.e., changes, including
	serial dependence, that can be attributed to usual operating conditions.
	The ensuing standardized innovation series are analyzed in the second
	part of the framework, which consists of using Shewhart and Memory
	Control Charts to detect special-cause or unusual events. We apply
	the framework to analyze strain and displacement data from the monitoring
	system on the Hurley Bridge (Wisconsin Structure B-26-7). Data were
	collected from April 1, 2010 to June 29, 2011. Our analysis reveals
	that, after controlling for seasonal effects, linear trends are significant
	components of the response measurements. Persistent displacement
	may be an indication of deterioration of the bridge supports. Trends
	in the strain data may indicate changes in the material properties,
	i.e., fatigue, sensor calibration, or traffic loading. The results
	also show that autocorrelation and conditional heteroscedasticity
	are significant sources of common-cause variation. Use of the control
	charts detected 43 possible special-cause events, with approximately
	50% displaying persisting effects, and 25% lasting longer than one
	week. Analysis of traffic data shows that unusually heavy loading
	is a possible cause of the longest special-cause event, which lasted
	11&\#xa0;days. },

	The formulations use condition information that stems from the operation

	complexity of the formulations. Through a computational study, we
	show that the economic benefits can be achieved by implementing the

	in situations where the initial expected deterioration rate of the
	facility is not a good representation of its actual deterioration

	of new roads before they have been built and of road <i>improvement
	interventions</i> before they have been performed. The guidelines
	with respect to standardised methodologies and models to be used
	have been developed (VSS 2003a) and are now in use. It is not yet,
	however, common practice to estimate the total benefits of road <i>preservation
	interventions</i> and hence guidelines do not exist with respect
	to standardised methodologies and models to be used. In order to
	provide this information, the research package VSS 2004/710-716 was
	started. This paper presents the methodology and models proposed
	to be used to evaluate the total benefits of road preservation interventions
	in Switzerland based on the evaluation and synthesis of existing
	national and international literature on the relationships between
	pavement condition and benefits of road use conducted in project
	714 of the research package. The use of the methodology and models
	are demonstrated by determining the optimal intervention strategy
	for a representative situation in Switzerland. The impact on the
	optimal intervention strategy of the consideration of multiple stakeholders
	is investigated.},

  abstract = {In Australian freight operations, maintenance costs comprise between
	25 -35 percent of total train operating costs. Therefore, it is important
	that the track maintenance planning function is undertaken in an
	effective and efficient manner. This paper focuses on the development
	of a model designed to help resolve the conflicts between train operations
	and the scheduling of maintenance projects. The model involves scheduling
	maintenance projects to minimise disruptions to train services and
	reduce maintenance costs. The main applicability of such a model
	is as a decision support tool for track maintenance planners and
	train planners. The track maintenance scheduling problem, which involves
	the allocation of maintenance projects to time windows and crews
	to projects, is formulated as an integer programming model. The objective
	is to minimise a weighted combination of expected interference delays
	and prioritised finishing time. Minimising the first component will
	ensure a minimum interference between track maintenance projects
	and scheduled trains when either are delayed. The heuristic solution
	is obtained in two stages. Firstly, an initial solution is generated,
	scheduling each of the projects in turn, where the latter are ordered
	in terms of the relative importance of finishing time. Each project
	is selected and allocated to an available permissible work crew.
	If there are no available permissible work crews when the project
	is chosen, the earliest finishing crew will be selected. The second
	stage uses the tabu search heuristic. The model presented here was
	applied to an 89 km track corridor on the eastern coast of Australia.
	The schedule constructed using tabu search has a 7 percent reduction
	in objective function value as compared to the schedule constructed
	manually. The model was also used to demonstrate the effects of project
	schedule and maintenance resource changes. A four day planning horizon
	was used for which the model was used to test proposed changes. Increasing
	the time window by moving less important trains was shown to reduce
	potential delays significantly.},

  abstract  = {A successful pavement management system requires an accurate pavement
	performance prediction model. A novel pavement performance model
	using the piecewise approximation approach was developed to estimate
	the pavement serviceable life. It can be broadly applied to estimate
	pavement performance of any distress types or indexes. The basic
	theory of the piecewise approximation is to divide the whole pavement
	serviceable life into three zones: Zone 1 for early age pavement
	distress, Zone 2 in rehabilitation stage, and Zone 3 for overdistressed
	situations. Historical pavement performance data are regressed independently
	in each time zone. This approach can accurately predict pavement
	distress progression trends in each individual zone by eliminating
	possible impacts from biased data in other zones. This paper describes
	the theoretical piecewise approximation process of data classification
	and model regression and then demonstrates an implementation for
	a group of Washington State Department of Transportation asphalt
	concrete pavements. The results are compared with the Mechanistic-Empirical
	Pavement Design Guide incremental damage approach, the current Washington
	State Pavement Management System (WSPMS) exponential model, and ordinary
	regression on all data points. Results indicate that the proposed
	approach is able to estimate the most accurate rehabilitation due
	year and to predict the performance trends for each divided zone.
	The piecewise approximation approach is planned for implementation
	into the WSPMS and will play an important role in decision making
	for future pavement rehabilitations.},

  abstract = {Four propositions drawn from 60 years of natural hazard and reconstruction
	research provide a comparative and historical perspective on the
	reconstruction of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Decisions
	taken over its 288-year history that have made New Orleans so vulnerable
	to Katrina reflect a long-term pattern of societal response to hazard
	events—reducing consequences to relatively frequent events, and increasing
	vulnerability to very large and rare events. Thus Katrina's consequences
	for New Orleans were truly catastrophic—accounting for most of the
	estimated 1,570 deaths of Louisiana residents and $40–50 billion
	in monetary losses. A comparative sequence and timing of recovery
	provides a calendar of historical experience against which to gauge
	progress in reconstruction. Using this calendar, the emergency postdisaster
	period appears to be longer in duration than that of any other studied
	disaster. The restoration period, the time taken to restore urban
	services for the smaller population, is in keeping with or ahead
	of historical experience. The effort to reconstruct the physical
	environment and urban infrastructure is likely to take 8–11 years.
	Conflicting policy goals for reconstruction of rapid recovery, safety,
	betterment, and equity are already evident. Actions taken demonstrate
	the rush to rebuild the familiar in contrast to planning efforts
	that emphasize betterment. Because disasters tend to accelerate existing
	economic, social, and political trends, the large losses in housing,
	population, and employment after Katrina are likely to persist and,
	at best, only partly recover. However, the possibility of breaking
	free of this gloomy trajectory is feasible and has some historical
	precedent.},

	function derived from the corresponding future state probabilities.
	The expected future distress ratings for a particular pavement project
	are then used to construct the corresponding performance curve. The
	generated performance curves form the basis for developing an effective
	mechanism for prioritizing potential rehabilitation projects. A priority
	ranking system is presented with two alternatives. The first priority
	ranking alternative requires a fixed analysis period wherein project
	candidates are evaluated by using three different long-term performance
	indicators derived from the corresponding performance curves. The
	deployed performance indicators include the area under the performance
	curve, the average distress rating, and the terminal distress rating.
	The second priority ranking alternative requires a fixed terminal
	distress rating for the pavement network under consideration. The
	time required for each project to reach the terminal distress rating
	is determined as the rehabilitation scheduling time, which is used
	to establish project priority ranking. Pavement rehabilitation project
	candidates are then scheduled according to their priority rankings
	and available budget. The developed probabilistic approach is demonstrated
	by considering a project sample from the two-lane highway system
	in Ohio.},

  abstract  = {Decision makers are always faced with the challenge of selecting and
	implementing cost-effective pavement preservation alternatives, particularly
	when encountering shrinking budgets and increased competition for
	funds. Pavement intervention and investment evaluation criteria used
	in past research and practice are reviewed. The synthesis of pavement
	preservation effectiveness and efficiency evaluation techniques that
	is presented is unique from both benefit and cost perspectives. Criteria
	are of the following categories: effectiveness (benefit) only, cost
	only, cost-effectiveness, and economic efficiency. Computational
	details, past applications, merits, and demerits of various evaluation
	criteria are discussed for each criterion. Then selected criteria
	are computed with data from a national pavement study; they are used
	to evaluate alternative rigid pavement rehabilitation treatments.
	The case study results suggest that the superior short-term effectiveness
	exhibited by a treatment does not necessarily translate into superior
	long-term effectiveness. The evaluation results can vary widely for
	cost only, effectiveness only, and both cost and effectiveness criteria.
	Thus, evaluation based on cost-only or effectiveness-only criteria
	can yield biased evaluation results. To be a suitable candidate,
	a treatment or strategy must be not only effective but also cost-effective
	and economically efficient and the incorporation of user costs into
	evaluation can significantly influence the evaluation results. Such
	a synthesis can be a vital support for highway agencies in decision
	making for infrastructure management in general and pavement management
	in particular.},

  abstract  = {The analysis of motorway renewal costs presented in this paper was
	driven by two research questions: First, to analyse the economic
	process of motorway renewal work and to identify whether there exist
	economies of scale; and second to identify the influence of traffic
	volume on renewal costs and to derive an estimate of marginal infrastructure
	costs as part of optimal road user charges. The analysis is based
	on cross-sectional data for motorway renewal costs and traffic volume
	in Germany during the period 1980-1999. Two translog models were
	estimated, each of them including the factor input prices for labour,
	material and capital, and a set of regional dummy variables as well
	as dummy variables for the type of material used for renewal. The
	first model includes in addition to these variables the sqm of renewed
	road as explanatory variable. The second model was constructed to
	analyse the relationship between traffic volume and renewal costs
	and contains the average annual daily traffic volume of trucks and
	passenger cars as independent variables. Two main results were derived
	from the models: First, motorway renewal work is characterised by
	substantial economies of scale. Second, the relationship between
	renewal costs and traffic volume is expressed by a cost elasticity,
	i.e., the ratio between marginal and average costs, which ranges
	from 0.05 up to 1.17 with a digressive increase of marginal costs.},

	Process) do not take into account the uncertainty in the measurement
	of facility condition. This paper presents a methodology, the Latent
	Markov Decision Process (LMDP), which explicitly recognizes the presence
	of random errors in the measurement of the condition of infrastructure
	facilities. Two versions of the LMDP are presented. In the first
	version, the inspection schedule is fixed, which is the usual assumption
	made in state-of-the-art models. The second version of the LMDP minimizes
	the sum of inspection and M & R costs. An empirical comparison of
	the two versions of the LMDP and the traditional MDP illustrates
	the importance of incorporating measurement uncertainty in decision-making
	and of optimizing the inspection schedule.},

  abstract  = {Rockfall barriers are optimized to absorb high punctual impact energies.
	In mountain areas the barriers are also loaded by avalanches and
	snow pressure. Snowpack forces and dynamic avalanche pressures act
	over a much larger area and over longer time periods. Thus, if not
	properly designed, rockfall barriers can be damaged. In winter 2003–2006
	we investigated the interaction of flexible rockfall barriers with
	avalanches and snow pressure on a study site in Fieberbrunn, Austria
	and in other areas. In several locations the barriers successfully
	stopped small wet snow avalanches. However, the main problem turned
	out to be the insufficient retention capacity during the whole winter
	and the structural behaviour. The weakest points are the retaining
	ropes and the post foundations. For an appropriate design of the
	barrier the main input factors determining snow pressure and avalanche
	pressure have to be assessed. },

  abstract  = {With cities accounting for approximately two thirds of the global
	demand for energy, there is significant scope to optimize energy
	usage of cities, in particular by improving the use of the built
	form. Large non-domestic buildings are increasingly the focus of
	attention, due to their substantial demands and associated environmental
	impacts such as \{CO2\} emissions. Various approaches have been adopted
	to address building energy efficiency, with more recent studies relating
	consumption patterns to human occupancy. This paper proposes a new
	method to measure activity, using WiFi connections as a proxy for
	human occupancy. Data on the number of WiFi connections and energy
	consumption (electricity, steam and chilled water) were compared
	for two buildings within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
	campus. The results of the study demonstrate: the operation of the
	heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems adhered
	more closely to factors other than occupancy i.e. external temperature,
	whilst a small part of the electricity levels did correlate with
	the occupancy. In order to present possible solutions to address
	the disconnect between the \{HVAC\} system and occupancy levels,
	this paper identifies future steps that could begin to improve energy
	usage. },

	dewormed to prevent the impairments to health and the economy caused
	by soil-transmitted helminths in endemic communities. It is important
	that managers of STH control programmes be able to anticipate the
	impact of the control measures on the prevalence of the diseases
	for two main purposes: <list list-type="bullet"> <list-item><p>to
	select the most appropriate intervention; and</p></list-item> <list-item><p>to
	be alerted in case of changes in prevalence that are less favourable
	than the expected values.</p></list-item> </list></p> <p>We therefore
	developed a model that predicts such changes, and also included modifications
	to enable its use in cases where a limited amount of data is available
	(SM1 and SM2). We retrospectively tested the performances of the
	model on 26 control programmes comparing the prevalence predicted
	by the model with those observed during programme implementation:
	in 77% of cases the prevalence predicted by the original model was
	within five percentage points of the observed values (69% in SM1
	and 60% in SM2). We consider the performances of these models to
	be satisfactory. We designed a free online software to facilitate
	the use of these models by programme managers who may not be confident
	with modelling procedures.</p>},

	predict the change in prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth (STH)
	infections during public health control activities is not available,
	but would be an extremely efficient planning tool.Method We used
	the parasitological data collected during a deworming and iron supplementation
	programme for women of child-bearing age conducted in Vietnam between
	2006 and 2011 to develop a Markov transition probability model. The
	transition probabilities were calculated from the observed changes
	in prevalence in the different classes of intensity for each STH
	species during the first year of intervention. The model was then
	developed and used to estimate the prevalence in year 2, 3, 4 and
	5 for each STH species and for ‘any STH infection’. The prevalence
	predicted by the model was then compared with the prevalence observed
	at different times during programme implementation.Results The comparison
	between the model-predicted prevalence and the observed prevalence
	proved a good fit of the model.Conclusions We consider the Markov
	transition probability model to be a promising method of predicting
	changes in STH prevalence during control efforts. Further research
	to validate the model with observed data in different geographical
	and epidemiological settings is suggested to refine the prediction
	model.},

	date at which repairs are necessary. Recent empirical work has identified
	another potentially more important social cost, for the damage to
	the pavement raises the operating costs of subsequent vehicles, and
	these operating costs may be an order of magnitude larger than the
	road maintenance costs. The paper develops a theory to handle this
	newly identified externality and establishes a remarkable result.
	If roads are repaired when they reach a predetermined critical condition
	(not necessarily optimally set) and if road damage is fully attributable
	to traffic, then in steady state with zero traffic growth the average
	road damage externality is zero, and the average marginal social
	cost of road use is equal to the average road maintenance cost. The
	result holds for arbitrary road damage and vehicle damage functions.
	Recent empirical studies reveal that weather accounts for a significant
	fraction of road deterioration, and in this case the road damage
	externality is no longer exactly zero, but is quantitatively negligible.
	The appropriate road user charge now only recovers the fraction of

  abstract  = {In this paper, a general reward model for a non homogeneous semi-Markov
	system will be provided. Both discrete and continuous time models
	will be studied considering reward to be a random variable of the
	economic type associated with the state occupancies and transitions.
	Basic equations will be exhibited and the main formulas for the expected
	reward that the system will generate in some interval of time (with
	and without discounting) will be determined for the discrete and
	continuous cases and a method is provided in order to find it in
	closed analytic form in relation with the basic parameters of the
	system. Also, results will be obtained for the expected reward per
	time period for the steady state.},

  abstract            = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies can be used to
	simulate hidden Markov model (HMM) parameters from their posterior
	distribution given observed data. Some MCMC methods used in practice
	(for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states,
	and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating
	established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is
	a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions
	of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I
	show how to use the recursive algorithms in an MCMC context and demonstrate
	mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using
	the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler
	often used for HMMs. I introduce an augmented variables technique
	for obtaining unique state labels in HMMs and finite mixture models.
	I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient
	use of MCMC output when estimating the hidden states. I directly
	calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space
	size by MCMC, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian
	information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently
	analyzed dataset in the HMM literature. The use of log-likelihood
	for assessing MCMC convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive
	checks are used to investigate application specific questions of
	model adequacy.},

  abstract = {The Pontis bridge management system is the predominant bridge management
	system employed in the United States. The system employs a network
	optimization model for preservation, formulated as a Markov decision
	process with a linear program solution procedure. On each bridge,
	a set of level-of-service standards determines functional needs,
	whose benefits are calculated according to a user cost model. A multi-year
	program simulation generates project alternatives by combining preservation
	and improvement needs on each bridge. The program is optimized within
	budget constraints by means of an incremental benefit/cost algorithm.
	The mathematical formulation of each of these components is presented
	and discussed. Aspects of system development and data management
	are outlined, along with the current implementation status. California's
	experience with the use of Pontis in its funding process is highlighted.},

  abstract  = {The problem of scheduling multiple feeds on parallel units is addressed.
	The performance of each unit is assumed to decrease with time, therefore
	requiringplanned maintenance to restore its performance. A mixed-integer
	nonlinear programming (MINLP) model presented uses the process information
	regarding the exponential decay in performance with time to find
	a cyclic schedule for feed processing. Optimization trade-off is
	between the performance of the units, and the maintenance costs and
	the loss in production due to shutdowns. Three main decisions for
	the optimal schedule are: a) assignment of various feeds to different
	units; b) processing time of each feed on different units; and c)
	number of subcycles of each feed on diferent units. Special mathematical
	properties of the MINLP model are exploited to solve the problem
	to global optimality with a branch-and-bound method. Using several
	examples advantages of the model are illustrated and performances
	of different solution algorithms are compared.},

	jointly to reduce the life-cycle cost of ballast. A life-cycle cost
	model is developed to incorporate a track deterioration model and
	a tamping model. Based on the models, three optimal policies of ballast
	T&R are investigated, which include fixed intervention level, constant
	interval of tamping, and optimal nonconstant intervals of tamping.
	Three algorithms are presented to obtain the optimal solutions for
	the three policies. An example is presented to illustrate model performance.
	From a whole life point of view, eight options based on the three
	policies are compared for a better understanding of the effectiveness
	of the policies. The results show that considerable benefit could
	be achieved by considering ballast tamping and renewal together and
	implementing the optimal policy.},

  abstract = {A road network consists of multiple objects that deteriorate over time with different speeds of deterioration. In order to provide an adequate level of service over time, these objects will eventually require interventions. As road managers are trying, in general, to maximize the benefit obtained from the road network, it is in their interest to determine intervention programs, which consist of the grouping of interventions in work zones. The determination of optimal intervention programs is relatively complicated when considering single objects, but it becomes even more so when considering multiple objects embedded within a network. The objects to be included in the work zones at each time interval depend on many factors, such as the interventions to be executed on the objects, the maximum allowable length of the work zones, the traffic configurations to be used in the work zones and the available financial resources. Although some initial research in this area has been conducted, none has determined the optimal set of work zones on large infrastructure networks in a geographical information system (GIS) framework, which is necessary in the world of modern infrastructure management. In the work presented in this paper, a GIS-based program was developed to determine optimal intervention programs for large infrastructure networks using a linear optimization model, which can be linked directly to a GIS. The model includes constraints on the amount of available resources, on the length of the work zone, and on the distance between two work zones. A constraint-constructing algorithm is used in order to set up the latter two constraints. The program is illustrated by determining the optimal set of work zones for an example road network similar to the one in the canton of Wallis, Switzerland, including more than 2,000 bridges, tunnels, and road sections.},
